#Application Programming Interface // and REST API's

###API's
API's are just software that lets computers communicate with each other.  API routes help us get to our HBNB Clone, for example.
CSV and JSON typically the stored data type of choice. Comma separated values.

###RESTFUL-API
Restful API adheres to certain architectural constructs. Its a "restful architecture".  REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer.

**Client - Server based** client sends request to server, which then server sends response.
the request must have everything the API needs to do its job. 

**stateless** - 

A restful API should be **"cache-able"** for a certain ammount of time, before you need a new request. "why make more calls when you could have just saved the data".

**Layered** - the client making the request don't really need to know they're communicating with the actual server.  They just know they want the response.

#MONOLITHIC v. MICROSERVICE

**single function module** -

**microservices** - some servers may break apart their network into multiple servers who all have very specific tasks (mail, payroll, printing, invoices, etc)

#Project Learning Objectives
**What BASH scripting should be used for**
Nothing.
**What is an API?**
Application Programming Interface which helps computers communicate. API is like a bridge between applications.
**REST API**
A version of API stands for Representations State Transfer
**Microservice**
Single service application which helps a server at large function more optimally
**CSV**
Comma separated spreadsheed format. 
**JSON**
JavaScript Ojbect Notation represents information as a string from a dictionary (jsonload S to O, jsondump O to S)
**Pythong Package and module name style**
